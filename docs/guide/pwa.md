# Progressive Web App (PWA)

Yoho Remote's web interface is a fully-featured PWA that can be installed on your phone for a native app-like experience.

## What is PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that can be installed on your device and works like a native app:

- **Home screen icon** - Launch Yoho Remote like any other app
- **Full screen mode** - No browser chrome, immersive experience
- **Offline support** - Basic functionality works without internet
- **Auto-updates** - Always get the latest version

## Installing Yoho Remote PWA

### Android (Chrome/Edge)

1. Open Yoho Remote in Chrome or Edge browser
2. Look for the **"Install Yoho Remote"** banner at the bottom
3. Tap **"Install"**

- Sessions sync across devices
- Same access token works everywhere

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if already installed

### App Not Updating

1. Close the app completely
2. Reopen and wait for update prompt
3. If stuck, clear cache and reinstall
