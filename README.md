# Yoho Remote

Yoho Remote means "哈皮," a Chinese transliteration of [Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy). Great credit to the original project.

Run Claude Code / Codex / Gemini sessions locally and control them remotely through a Web / PWA / Telegram Mini App.

> **Why Yoho Remote?** Yoho Remote is a local-first alternative to Happy. See [Why Not Happy?](docs/WHY_NOT_HAPPY.md) for the key differences.

## Features

- Start AI coding sessions from any machine.
- Monitor and control sessions from your phone or browser.
- Approve or deny tool permissions remotely.
- Browse files and view git diffs.
- Track session progress with todo lists.
- Supports multiple AI backends: Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini.
